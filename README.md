Spirit Editor

TODO:

In progress
  Config file support (Set your paths, things like that).  (Partial.  Config supported.  Editing config in UI not yet supported.)
  
  Genericize table import(?)  (Could i check for first XML tag with a hash?)
  
  Genericize table Export     (Could i check for first XML tag with a hash?)

Coming up

  Separate out and properly organize objects by file.  Eg, have parsing of spirit battle DB being done for the whole file.  Abstract it out for all instances we want.  
  
  More randomizer settings 
    
  Make "Earn a fighters" more specific(?))
  
  Make custom "Event types" where they're specifically formatted battle types.  Bosses are an example (skew high scale and damage)  Other ideas?
    
    Swarm of easy fighters
    
    A lot of one fighter
    
    Giga Bowser (don't give him a final smash tho)
    
    Final level scroll
    
    Enemy has instant final smash
    
    Food party
    
    "David vs. Goliath"
    
    Sporadic events.  Make them occur much more frequently.

  Export/import individual fighters
  
  Edit Item Tables
  
  Add custom "Final Boss" spirit
  
  If we set Recommended Skills based off an attribute, remove some of the randomized skills to avoid too much noise in Recommendations.
