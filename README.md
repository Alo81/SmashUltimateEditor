TODO:

  Config file support (Set your paths, things like that).  
  
  Separate out and properly organize objects by file.  Eg, have parsing of spirit battle DB being done for the whole file.  Abstract it out for all instances we want.  
  
  ~~Manually set load (with a saved default)~~
  
  Automatically Encrypt after save
  
  ~~Add individual fighters to battles~~
  
  More randomizer settings 
  
  ~~battle types~~
    
  ~~bosses~~ (Kind of.  Bosses don't work, but added custom boss subtype that makes larger, more powerful standard enemies.)
    
  Make "Earn a fighters" more specific(?))
  
  Make custom "Event types" where they're specifically formatted battle types.  Bosses are an example (skew high scale and damage)  Other ideas?
    
    Swarm of easy fighters
    
    A lot of one fighter
    
    Giga Bowser (don't give him a final smash tho)
    
    Final level scroll
    
    Enemy has instant final smash
    
    Food party
    
    "David vs. Goliath"
    
    Sporadic events.  Make them occur much more frequently.

  Randomizer difficulty skewing
  
  ~~Export/import individual battles~~
  
  Export/import individual fighters
  
  Genericize table import(?) (Could i check for first XML tag with as hash?)
  
  Edit Item Tables
  
  Add custom "Final Boss" spirit
  
  If we set Recommended Skills based off an attribute, remove some of the randomized skills to avoid too much noise in Recommendations.

Apparently, Boss Spirits work in World of Light, but not from spirit Rematch.  Good to know.
